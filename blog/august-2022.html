        <strong>Did you miss MetaProvide last month?</strong>
      </h1>
      <p>
        With so much happening internally at
        <a href="https://metaprovide.org/">MetaProvide</a>, we had to focus on
        our projects, objectives and team so we were absent last month for the
        blog.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now we&#39;re back, stronger than ever and ready to keep you up to date
        on our organisation, platforms, achievements and lessons learned along
        this journey.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, we&#39;re ready to bring you different and innovative
        content. Whether you&#39;ve been with us from the beginning or have
        decided to join us just now, our objective remains the same: to help
        people.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, grab a coffee and your favorite seat to enjoy our blog.
        We&#39;re so happy to share our latest accomplishments on this journey
        with you.

      <h3 id="the-metagathering-20-was-a-huge-success">
        <strong>The MetaGathering 2.0 was a huge success!</strong>
      </h3>
      <img

      />
      <p>
        Our annual team meeting, that took place the first week of July along
        the coast of Portugal, in Lourinhã, was a big success. It was incredible
        for us to grow and develop our skills, ideas and projects, as well as
        strengthen our ties and unite as a team, more than ever.
      </p>
      <h3 id="why-have-an-annual-team-meeting">
        Why have an annual team meeting?
      </h3>
      <p>
        For most of the year we are 100% remote. We&#39;re interacting through
        online video conferences, working together on shared documents and
        looking at a screen for most of the day.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remote work has many advantages, especially the flexibility which allows
        for a team of people from different cities, countries and cultures. In
        fact, this makes our team unique!
      </p>
      <p>
        However, something is missing when people are not close-by to interact
        and work together directly. To improve as individuals and a team, as
        well as deliver the best projects possible to MetaProvide, MetaGathering
        has become our tradition to interact in person!
      </p>
      <h3 id="why-meet-in-portugal">Why meet in Portugal?</h3>
      <p>
        Our organisation was born in Sweden, but we have many roots in Portugal
        which brought us to this beautiful country.
      </p>
      <p>
        Several people from our team are based in Portugal and we have a great
        connection with the Monastery of Ericeira, thanks to the founder of
        MetaProvide, a former Buddhist monk. We also own land in Sourões where
        we&#39;ll create our community, MetaLand.
      </p>
      <h3 id="how-was-the-metagathering-this-year">
        How was the MetaGathering this year?
      </h3>
      <p>
        This year was particularly unique and special for us at MetaPovide! Our
        team has grown so much since the last gathering, so this was the first
        time that many of us got to meet in person and spend an entire week
        together.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to exploring important parts of our story, we worked
        together to develop as a team and begin new projects through a shared
        vision.
      </p>
      <p>
        How was this accomplished? We grew together through workshops and group
        activities, walks and team dinners, as well as meetings with MetaProvide
        clients, advisors and partners.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the end, what really mattered: the unity of all those involved to
        reach the same goal of helping more and more people with our platforms
        and potential projects.
      </p>
      <h3 id="metaland-our-dream-and-project-in-physical-form">
        <strong>MetaLand: our dream and project, in physical form!</strong>
      </h3>
      <p>
        We&#39;re constantly talking about
        <a href="https://metaprovide.org/areas">MetaLand</a> around here: either
        through our blog, website or just chatting with someone on our team.
        MetaLand is always in our thoughts simply because, at least until now,
        it is our only fully physically project.
      </p>
      <p>
        You see, MetaLand will be built on land located in a small village in
        central Portugal. We have big dreams for this land, focused on improving
        the experience of our platforms.
      </p>
      <h3 id="what-exactly-is-metaland">What, exactly, is MetaLand?</h3>
      <p>
        MetaLand has the potential to be many things for you, us and our
        partners. We believe that this space could mean something different to
        each individual, but we all share the same intention: a place to
        construct our community.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether it is a place for providers to network, for explorers to find
        other types of help, or different people to join in spiritual retreats,
        the principle objective is to create connections between people. These
        connections are the foundations for building our communities and
        involving more and more people around us.
      </p>
      <h3 id="how-will-we-build-this-project">
        How will we build this project?
      </h3>
      <p>
        In partnership with our architect, the idea is for this place to have a
        strong connection with nature, as an open space. At the same time, it
        has closed facilities specifically for the colder months, ready to
        receive diverse groups and different types of gatherings.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project is still in development, so we will keep you updated about
        it!
      </p>
      <p>When will we have more updates about MetaLand?</p>
      <img
        src="../assets/images/taking-measurement-metaland.jpeg"
        alt="taking measurement on metaland"
      />
      <p>
        This project is steadily developing, especially because we&#39;re
        focused on other solutions to help more people. But make no mistake: we
        are, with each passing week, more committed to getting this project off
        the ground.
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, a lot has been done over the last year so construction can
        begin once we have the project well defined. To get the inside scoop on
        how this real life dream is progressing, stay tuned for our blog updates
        and sign up for our newsletter so you don&#39;t miss out!

      <h3 id="insidely-is-finally-upon-us">
        <strong>Insidely is finally upon us!</strong>
      </h3>
      <p>
        After many ideas, insights, workshops, meetings and activities, finally
        our much anticipated platform has a name: Insidely!
      </p>
      <h3 id="what-is-insidely">What is Insidely?</h3>
      <p>
        You probably know Insidely by it&#39;s previous name, MetaFriend. This
        will be our 100% free platform for Explorers, those who seek growth or
        want support in some form to find their way in the world.
      </p>
      <h3 id="why-the-name-insidely">Why the name Insidely?</h3>
      <p>
        To decide on the the name Insidely, there was much thought and
        discussion. We considered our main objective: reach people who are
        searching to truly know themselves internally, to understand and
        effectively respond to those feelings inside, whatever they may be.
      </p>
      <h3 id="how-will-this-work-on-the-platform">
        How will this work on the platform?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Insidely aims to connect people looking for answers and wanting to grow
        with qualified well-being providers. We aim to have a vast range of
        providers like psychotherapists, Qi-gong instructors and skilled coaches
        to help you. We’re creating a free volunteer-based service to help
        millions of people on their many journeys of self-discovery.

      <p>
        Welcome to our second-ever MetaNewsletter! We&#39;ve got lots of updates
        and even some ways you can get involved in our mission to do good in the
        world. Just read on to learn about our <a href="#metaprovide-has-a-new-look">new look</a>, <a href="#adminly-is-here-to-help-others-help-more">latest products</a>

        <strong>MetaProvide has a new look!</strong>

      <p style="text-align: center"><img style="width: 50%" src="../assets/images/metaprovide-new-logo.png" alt="pic of new logo" /></p>
      <h4 id="what-comes-to-your-mind-when-you-think-about-branding">
        What comes to your mind when you think about Branding?
      </h4>
      <p>
        When we talk about Branding, people usually think we are talking only
        about icons, colors, letters, format and everything related to brand
        building. Of course, all this is part of the process, essential for the
        work of the brand, but Branding is much more than that.
      </p>
      <p>
        Branding and Marketing are often conflated and, while related, there is
        a very big difference between the two. When we talk specifically about
        Marketing, we are focused on selling a product or service. We are
        talking about conversions, numbers. Now, when we talk about Branding,
        feelings and emotions will always be the priority.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we decided to work on Branding, we wanted people to genuinely
        identify and connect with us. We at MetaProvide, as you know, are unlike
        any other organisation out there. As a not-for-profit, we need to raise
        awareness and connect people, to reach our goal of reducing human
        suffering.
      </p>
      <p>Therefore, we decided to work on rebranding our brand!</p>
      <h4 id="what-it-is-the-rebranding-process">
        What it is the rebranding process?
      </h4>
      <p>
        The process of rebranding is a decision to update what represents and
        distinguishes us, since the brand ultimately gives life and face to
        <a href="https://metaprovide.org/">MetaProvide</a>. There are several
        formats to do a rebranding, from very radical to simple, with small
        changes to minute details, ultimately making all the difference.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rebranding is usually done when something has changed, is changing or
        growing. With each passing day, the brand&#39;s message has to become
        clearer, leading to more dialogue with consumers and attracting new
        connections.
      </p>
      <p>Rebranding was inevitable for us and came at the perfect time...</p>
      <h4 id="why-did-we-rebrand">Why did we rebrand?</h4>
      <p>
        You may be surprised to know that the logo we have replaced today is not
        our first. On the contrary, this is actually our second logo, and a lot
        has changed since the creation of MetaProvide.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center"><img style="width: 50%" src="../assets/images/metaprovide.png" alt="pic of first logo" /></p>
      <p>
        MetaProvide is in a constant process of learning, evolution and
        development. To be able to keep up with this growth, and still maintain
        our essence, our values, motivations and purpose, our brand needs to
        advance with us and the message we are conveying to the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        With our first logo, the concept centred upon our four main values:
        sustainability, integrity, kindness and trustworthiness. Through these
        values, we wanted to illustrate why MetaProvide was founded.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now we want to reach and help more people, whether through Adminly, or
        through new products in the future. Our shared belief is the more you
        help, whether providers or explorers, the better.
      </p>
      <p>
        As our essence has matured, with new purposes and products developed
        along the way, our brand needed to reflect this change. In addition, our
        team has grown, our diversity has increased and, more than ever, we must
        put our values ​​into practice internally and externally.
      </p>
      <p>That&#39;s why rebranding came at such a perfect time.</p>
      <h4 id="about-our-rebranding">About our rebranding</h4>
      <p>
        Our rebranding took place to convey our message with greater clarity and
        simplicity. The values which brought us here remain intact. But the
        space we hope to open and present to those wanting or seeking help must
        be projected through our logo.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our creative process involved the direction of the Branding and
        Marketing team, with input from MetaProvide&#39;s internal team. Through
        meetings, conversations, forms and brainstorms, everyone was involved
        from the beginning to capture our essence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks to the team&#39;s ideas and insights, we have an exciting result
        that we hope will captivate all those who come to know us.
      </p>
      <h3>A picture says a thousand words</h3>
      <p style="text-align: center;">
        <img style="width: 50%;" src="../assets/images/metaprovide_square_320.png" alt="new logo of metaprovide">
      </p>
      <p>
        The idea is simple but profound: a logo with a human hand that is
        asymmetrical, conveying equality. It also gives a sense of humanisation,
        an invaluable aspect of our daily internal interactions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The leaf in the middle of the hand represents our value of
        sustainability. These images tied together through a single line
        illustrates the connection we must create with all those willing to join
        us along this adventure.
      </p>
      <h3>What&#39;s in a name?</h3>
      <p>
        Within the logo text, you may have noticed Meta is emphasised. Meta
        comes from a combination of two words.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Meta</strong> – More comprehensive : transcending (A word of
          Greek origin).
          <ul>
            <li>
              Connotations: <em><strong>Western</strong></em>
              <em>worldview, Brainy, Scientific, Thinking.</em>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Metta</strong> – Loving kindness : friendliness : benevolence
          (A word in Pali, with Buddhist origin).
          <ul>
            <li>
              Connotations: <em><strong>Eastern</strong></em>
              <em>worldview, Hearty, Spiritual, Sensing.</em>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It is thanks to Metta that we are all here today and ready to move
        onwards. The rebranding process can be challenging, but necessary for
        our image to depict our evolution.
      </p>
      <p>
        For now, this is MetaProvide&#39;s new logo, and we&#39;re ready to
        connect with the world.

      <h2 id="adminly-is-here-to-help-others-help-more">
        Adminly is here to help others help more!
      </h2>
      <p>
        Our new website for <a href="https://www.adminly.org/">Adminly</a> has
        finally launched! You&#39;re very welcome to visit us and bring friends,
        the more the merrier. We are excited to introduce you to our services,
        specifically designed with and for well-being providers. But perhaps
        you&#39;d like a little more background before your accept our friendly
        invitation...
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="https://space.metaprovide.org/s/FPBGoyW25DnEipK/download" alt="Screenshot Adminly login page"/>
      </p>
      <h3>What is Adminly?</h3>
      <p>
        Adminly aims to help well-being providers help more through a secure
        all-in-one, fully open source platform, and the personal touch of human
        virtual assistance. Although our platform simpliflies administrative
        tasks through automation, we also recognise the irreplaceable value of
        real human contact. That&#39;s why we have virtual assistants with
        genuine smiles (not bots, thank you very much)!
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>I&#39;m a well-being provider, can Adminly help me?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Most definitely, that&#39;s why we&#39;re here. In the future, Adminly
        will be a paid service, but right now you have the opportunity to
        receive individualised administrative support completely free! We do
        have a waiting list, so the sooner you sign up, the more likely you will
        be selected for this exclusive offer. Let our platform and human virtual
        assistants take on those tasks that eat away at your time and energy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Check out this video to see how we developed logos, according to their
        unique needs.
      </p>
      <div class="video-wrapper">

      </div>
      <h3>How does Adminly help others help more?</h3>
      <p>
        With the support of virtual assistants, our well-being providers have
        enjoyed more free time while also reaching more clients. But perhaps
        this comes as no surprise to you?! Day-to-day admin tasks do take their
        toll, especially when you&#39;re trying to juggle multiple apps and
        worrying about data privacy. We help simplify your business, enabling
        you to expand, which is a big win for both your and your clients.
      </p>
      <h3>Why is this service free right now?</h3>
      <p>
        We&#39;re still developing our Adminly services, so you will be
        providing valuable insight about how to best meet providers&#39; needs.
        We have already invested over 2 years of research and development with
        well-being providers, just like you, at the heart of our process.
        Through well over 400 hours of assistance, we have found innovative
        solutions for addressing various needs, but every provider is unique and
        we want to learn how we can help you best.
      </p>
      <h3>What inspired MetaProvide to create Adminly?</h3>
      <p>
        Well-being providers contribute to the well-being of both our local and
        global communities. This support is essential, especially in these
        challenging times. Although well-being providers are experts at helping
        others, who do the have to turn to with all the pressures of running an
        independent business? We are dedicated to addressing their unique
        business needs so they can reach more people while taking care of
        themselves as well.
      </p>
      <h3>Where can I get more information?</h3>
      <p>
        Check out our newly launched website for Adminly. Have a good
        nose-around and don&#39;t forget to invite some friends! Also, be sure
        to <a href="../index#newsletter-section">sign up</a> for our monthly MetaNewsletter so you don&#39;t

        All-in-one platform to simplify your business
      </h2>
      <p>
        Mark your calendars and drum roll please for the first release of
        Adminly (Alpha version) on June 21st!
      </p>
      <p>
        <img

        />
      </p>
      <p>
        This fully open source platform was developed to meet the specific needs
        of well-being providers. With over 23 dedicated team members, we
        identified and created tools to simplify your work, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A dashboard for quickly booking new appointments while scanning
          upcoming events, the status of your sessions and new clients
        </li>
        <li>
          A custom calendar to easily locate your free appointment slots and
          details about each booked event
        </li>
        <li>
          A public web page for clients to book appointments according to your
          availability (say good-bye to those back and forth emails arranging
          times!)
        </li>
        <li>
          Automated email notifications so clients don&#39;t forget your
          appointments...or payments
        </li>
        <li>
          Secure, but easily accessible video conferencing (no last-minute
          panics about accessing your Skype account...or was it Zoom you agreed
          upon?!)
        </li>
        <li>
          An app for managing your clients, with key details and attended
          sessions at your finger tips
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This is just the beginning. A select group of providers will test this
        version, leveraging these tools for free while enabling us to make
        further improvements. Be sure to sign up to our <a href="https://www.adminly.org/">waiting list</a> if you&#39;re

      <h2 id="volunteers-urgently-needed">Volunteers urgently needed</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Can you spare just 30 minutes to help us do good?</strong> We
        are developing a new product and need to interview volunteers as part of
        our research process.
      </p>
      <h3>What is this new product?</h3>
      <p>
        We&#39;re creating a volunteer-guided service that connects people to a
        diverse network of well-being professionals. In other words, we want to
        help people find their way, for free!
      </p>
      <h3>Can I volunteer?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes, most likely! If you have ever volunteered for any organisation
        before and/or sought out well-being services, then we would love to
        interview you. All volunteers and/or explorers are welcome to these
        interviews, so please do pass the word on to any friends who may be
        interested.
      </p>
      <h3>Wait, what exactly are explorers?</h3>
      <p>
        People exploring themselves and trying to find their place in the world
        through therapy and well-being services. This includes people who were
        prompted to explore due to some type of distress or purely due to
        curiosity and desire for personal growth.
      </p>
      <h3>I&#39;m in, now how do I volunteer?</h3>
      <p>
        Wonderful to have you onboard! Please contact

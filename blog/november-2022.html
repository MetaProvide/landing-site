        With so many accomplishments, MetaProvide still has a long - and good -
        way to go
      </h1>
      <p>
        Our team today consists of almost 20 people. We are based across Europe,
        representing different origins and nationalities. Therefore, each one of
        us brings a unique set of tools to support the process of creating
        MetaProvide and its respective projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are here because we strongly believe in MetaProvide's mission and
        vision. And together, we are determined to achieve our objective: reduce
        individual suffering through human-centered IT services that foster
        inner growth in everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our journey is far from over and we continue to learn from the numerous
        experiences along the way.

      <h3 id="urban-tech-hackathon">
        We participated in the
        <a href="https://www.urbantech-project.eu/">Urban Tech Hackathon</a> in
        Lithuania!
      </h3>
      <p>
        Thanks to a lot of research, time, and effort invested into applying for
        various programs, we were finally accepted to take part in our first
        grant competition!
      </p>
      <p>
        Urban Tech is a 3-year project funded by the European Union's Horizon
        2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement No 101005301.
        This program aims to promote business acceleration related to
        HealthTech, SmartCity, and GreenTech.
      </p>
      <p>
        Among the various startups registered, we were one of the 320 selected
        to participate in their Hackathon, which took place on November 18th -
        19th in Lithuania.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our Product Team and the MetaProvide Founder represented us at the
        event. In addition to pitching our solution and project, we took
        advantage of the opportunity to network, participate in workshops, learn
        from the best and improve our skills.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <h3 id="how-did-the-hackathon-work">How did the Hackathon work?</h3>
      <p>
        After an intense application process, a selection was made.
        MetaProvide&#39;s Adminly was one of 320 projects chosen to compete in
        the HealthTech category, with the theme &quot;2% of the world population
        can&#39;t get effective home treatment&quot;.
      </p>
      <p>
        We were invited to make a pitch about how
        <a href="https://www.adminly.org/">Adminly</a> can make a difference in
        the lives of patients and physicians. Our project saves up to 30% of
        well-being providers&#39; time through the help of VAs taking on
        administrative tasks. Providers are then able to fully focus on their
        practice and connect with more patients.
      </p>
      <p>
        This event was about more than just pitching our project. We also had
        the opportunity to participate in lectures and workshops, which helped
        with formulating and delivering our pitch, as well as providing useful
        tips, ideas, direction and knowledge to apply throughout the
        organisation&#39;s trajectory.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another advantage of participating in this event was the chance to be in
        front of so many large and potential projects. Lots of networking
        moments were promoted to meet competitors, form partnerships and
        introduce ourselves informally to potential partners and investors.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this way, we had the pleasure to engage in interesting conversations
        with several talented participants, like the folks from
        <a href="https://emplastrum.tech/our-story">Emplastrum</a>,
        <a href="https://en.guvenfuture.com/">Guvenfuture</a>,
        <a href="https://skinuvita.com/">Skinuvita</a> and
        <a href="https://moxyid.se/">MoxyID</a>. Our conversations and exchanges
        felt full of potential and, we&#39;d like to thank them for this
        opportunity as well. We hope to participate in more exchanges soon,
        either online or in person.

        Who attended and what was the impact of our participation?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Considering our year-end priorities and the future in 2023, we decided
        to send 3 key people to properly represent MetaProvide: João Raposo, our
        Product Development Manager, Tiago Lamelas, our Product Research Manager
        and, finally, Björn Magalhães, our Founder and Chairman. Together, they
        spoke on behalf of our organisation, explaining our desire to make a
        difference in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite having only 3 team members physically present, the rest of the
        group was sending good vibes and practical support to successfully
        deliver this task. The distance was no obstacle for our organisation to
        work together, from our Marketing to our Tech Team.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to introducing Adminly to more people outside our circle, we
        had the opportunity to demonstrate a little about our organisation. We
        shared who we are, where we come from, and our mission to make a
        difference in people&#39;s lives, be it professionally or personally.
      </p>
      <p>
        To get a clearer picture of our participation at the event, our
        representatives shared what this experience was like for each of them:
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>João, Product Development Manager</b> - It was a great learning
        experience, we had the opportunity to improve our pitching skills and
        implement a new version of our financial model. After this event, we are
        able to understand better the perspective of an investor who is looking
        at a startup.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Tiago, Product Research Manager</b> - The workshops during Hackathon
        helped us to validate some assumptions that we had and also question
        ourselves on some strategic moves. By reviewing previous work, we were
        challenged to see the same problems from other points of view. The high
        calibre of other teams motivates us to bring more value to the next
        competition.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Björn, Founder, and Chairman</b> - I feel very proud of how we rode
        this unpredictable roller-coaster-adventure together with cheerfulness.
        For teams like ours which work primarily online, it felt profoundly
        meaningful to spend time together, working relentlessly with great
        effort and sharing our vision. To be supported by team members not
        on-site, but in spirit, working on various tasks was a good experience.
        It was fun to meet other developers who also are producing uplifting
        solutions to improve the state of the world.
      </p>

        />
      </p>
      <h3 id="what-were-our-lessons-from-this-experience">
        What were our lessons from this experience?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Since our work is 100% remote, this fully face-to-face Hackathon was
        invaluable. This experience, along with all the lessons learnt along the
        way, will remain with us for life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, experiences like this include ups and downs, which our team
        definitely went through. It was our first time representing our
        organisation and main project in a Hackathon, so far from home, and
        totally out of our comfort zone. Learning to be prepared for adversities
        and being resilient is what makes us stronger.
      </p>
      <p>
        We still managed to get the best out of this event. Beyond just being
        there for the unique experience, we were able to learn from other
        startups and workshops. We had the opportunity to improve our current
        pitch and learn, with the best, how to refine our work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps the biggest takeaway was recognising there is a giant world of
        opportunities that we must explore, investigate, and connect with.
        Instead of just attending meetings and virtual meetings, we have to
        project our image and brand to people outside the online world. The
        offline world is here and we must be part of it!
      </p>
      <p>
        So, first of all, we want to thank our team. Those who were physically
        present at the event, gave their all on behalf of our organisation,
        despite the many obstacles faced.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, a thank you to everyone who made our project happen and enabled us
        take part in this event. You&#39;re helping turn dreams into something
        concrete and tangible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, thank you for accompanying us on this journey. Your support
        makes us even stronger and committed to this unique and beautiful
        objective. Thank you for the inspiration to go even further.
      </p>
      <p>Thanks!</p>

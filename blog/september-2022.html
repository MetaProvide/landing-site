      <h1 id="a-month-of-trials-and-triumphs">
        A month of trials and triumphs
      </h1>
      <p>
        We human beings, by nature, struggle with change. Whether good or bad,
        it&#39;s difficult to adapt to something unexpected in our lives and
        routines, no matter how much we want to. The month of September was full
        of changes and adaptations, so a rather delicate time, but also an
        important learning opportunity for everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the release of Adminly, we reached the end of phase 2 of our
        project. That&#39;s why we&#39;ve decided on new goals and objectives to
        guide us through the end of the year. Even with a well-thought-out plan
        and strategy, surprises happen, but ultimately serve to strengthen and
        unite us as a team.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the midst of this challenging situation, a great achievement emerged,
        which motivated and inspired the entire Meta team. So, of course,
        we&#39;re proud to finally share this latest triumph with you and our
        entire community.
      </p>
      <h3 id="we-have-launched-the-swarm-nextcloud-plugin">
        We have launched the Swarm Nextcloud plugin!
      </h3>
      <p>
        For 3+ years, we&#39;ve been using Nextcloud as our working environment
        and the backend of the products we&#39;re developing for our customers.
        <a href="https://www.adminly.org/">Adminly</a> is one such product.
      </p>
      <p>
        We spent one year developing this software, a year full of technical
        challenges. But what we achieved will have a great impact on Nextcloud,
        Swarm, and of course, MetaProvide!
      </p>
      <img src="../assets/images/blogpost-september-2022/1.png" alt="Swarm, MetaProvide and Nextcloud logotypes"/>
      <h3 id="so-what-is-this-software">So what is this software?</h3>
      <p>
        In a nutshell, we made Nextcloud compatible with Swarm, bringing you
        decentralised file storage connected to the blockchain.
      </p>
      <p>
        The plugin creates a bridge between Nextcloud&#39;s server-based
        platform and Swarm&#39;s decentralised storage connected to the
        blockchain. This connection provides powerful storage and backup
        solutions, decreases reliance on central servers, and reduces the risk
        of attacks and downtime, while increasing redundancy, security, and
        privacy.
      </p>
      <h3 id="what-are-the-advantages-for-nextcloud-and-swarm">
        What are the advantages for Nextcloud and Swarm?
      </h3>
      <p>
        We saw great potential in joining these two platforms through a plugin
        because both have competitive, complementary advantages which ultimately
        benefit everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
        For Swarm, we foresee new users and also self-hosters becoming node
        operators; generating greater sales of BZZ (Swarm Tokens).
      </p>
      <p>
        For Nextcloud, there&#39;s the benefit of connecting to the crypto &amp;
        blockchain world, while the app is also a great feature of Nextcloud 25.
        Moreover, this is the first step for Nextcloud and its users towards the
        bright future of gradual Web3.0 integration.
      </p>

      <h3 id="why-did-metaprovide-decide-to-create-this-connection">
        Why did MetaProvide decide to create this connection?
      </h3>
      <p>
        First of all, this was a gift to Viktor Trón, expressing our gratitude
        for his partnership with us. In addition to Viktor&#39;s generous
        support, Swarm recently offered MetaProvide a grant of S10,000 BZZ (DAI,
        which is crypto measured in USD).
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, we were excited about creating a wholesome link between two
        awesome projects - NextCloud and Swarm - united through code. Be sure to
        stay tuned for the latest updates, as more collaboration is on the
        horizon.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, we wanted to prove that, even with a small team, we can do
        something great with limited resources, demonstrating our growing
        capacity.
      </p>
      <h3 id="when-will-it-be-launched">When will it be launched?</h3>
      <p>
        This plugin is available on the Nextcloud AppStore, just in time for the
        Nextcloud 25 release...so it&#39;s already
        <a href="https://metaprovide.org/nextcloud-swarm-plugin">out there</a>!
      </p>
      <p>
        We were able to launch before attending the Nextcloud Berlin Conference
        (October 1st-4th), which was a huge achievement for MetaProvide!
      </p>
      <p>
        A big thank you goes out to our tech team for giving so much of
        themselves to this project. Their dedication allowed us to deliver on a
        tight, but important deadline. Thank you tech team!
      </p>
      <h3 id="nextcloud-berlin-conference-we-were-there">
        Nextcloud Berlin Conference: we were there!
      </h3>
      <p>
        This past weekend, as mentioned above, some of our team members attended
        the Nextcloud Berlin Conference.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our tech team was joined by our founder, Bjorn Magalhães, and our HR
        Manager, Marcela Munoz. Together they networked, delved deeper into this
        technological world, and presented MetaProvide&#39;s achievements.
      </p>
      <p><img src="../assets/images/blogpost-september-2022/3.png" alt="Nextcloud file view with swarm plugin"/></p>
      <p>
        On our second day at the event, we had the opportunity to take the stage
        with team member, Ron Trevor, to introduce MetaProvide and our latest
        release: the Swarm Nextcloud plugin. Ron, who wrote major parts of the
        app code, explained the basic use of the plugin with Swarm Tokens (BZZ)
        used in the incentivised system running on the Swarm bee-nodes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Watch his presentation on &quot;<a
          href="https://youtu.be/Aad2BuGudnE?t=19141"
          >Decentralized sovereign cloud storage on the Nextcloud App Store!</a
        >&quot;. <strong>Please note</strong>: By a slip of the tongue an error
        crept into the talk. Viktor Tron was an early <em>developer</em> of
        Ethereum before creating Swarm (but he was not a <em>founder</em> of
        Ethereum).
      </p>
      <p>
        It was an incredible weekend, with lots of knowledge exchanged, which
        will make all the difference to our team and the future of our great
        project, as it continues to grow.

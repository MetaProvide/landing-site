        A techy start-up on a well-being mission
      </h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to our very first blog post on this humble homepage. We are a
        start-up not-for-profit in the well-being sector.
      </p>
      <p>
        You’ll soon read about our most recent
        <a href="#recent-achievements">achievements</a>and how we’re
        accelerating towards further developments on the
        <a href="#on-our-horizon">horizon</a>. But before we delve into these
        exciting updates, let’s begin with a brief introduction of who we are,
        our aspirations, and how we intend to get there.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our mission can be summed up in a rather long less-than-catchy sentence:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          MetaProvide brings goodness to the world by developing administrative
          wellbeing-services; through innovative IT and supportive human
          interaction.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Not <em><strong>entirely clear</strong></em
        >? Fair enough. Sometimes a video helps. This one describe our service
        Adminly.

        So is MetaProvide connected to Facebook?
      </h3>
      <p>
        <em><strong>No! Absolutely not.</strong></em> The similarities in name
        are...unfortunate, to say the least. We are completely opposed to
        data-mining for profit and that&#39;s part of the reason we&#39;re
        creating a platform for well-being providers and explorers to safely
        connect.
      </p>
      <p>
        Relieved to have cleared that up! Now let&#39;s answer those
        all-important <em>who, what, where, when, why,</em> and
        <em>how</em> questions (although not in that order)!
      </p>
      <h3 id="who-are-we">Who are we?</h3>
      <p>
        A <a href="https://metaprovide.org/team">diverse team</a> of
        programmers, product developers, administrators, communicators, business
        advisers, and a former Buddhist monk give life to MetaProvide. We have
        different backgrounds and beliefs, but share a common vision motivated
        by
        <a href="https://space.metaprovide.org/s/GMnyRJeDcPwGidD"
          >core values</a
        >
        of kindness, integrity, trustworthiness and sustainability.
      </p>
      <h3 id="where-are-we-based">Where are we based?</h3>
      <p>
        Our not-for-profit is registered in Sweden and we are developing a
        retreat-place in Portugal, but we are truly an international community.
        Thanks to our online open source platform, our team from around the
        world work with well-being providers throughout Europe.
      </p>
      <h3 id="what-are-we-doing">What are we doing?</h3>
      <p>
        We are building services for the commercial market, but with a deep
        commitment to supporting the greater good. These services will help both
        well-being providers and explores to truly grow and succeed, especially
        in challenging times.

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p><a href="../areas#adminly">Adminly</a></p>
          <p>
            A web-based all-in-one administrative tasks platform, designed
            specifically for well-being providers, with personalized support
            from virtual assistants.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><a href="../areas#metafriend">MetaFriend</a></p>
          <p>
            An entirely free service to connect well-being explorers with vetted
            providers, according to their individual needs and aspirations.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><a href="../areas#metaland">MetaLand</a></p>
          <p>
            Our bit of land in the Portuguese country-side for harmonizing
            multi-disciplinary approaches to well being through permaculture,
            tech-labs and meditation huts.

      <p>
        We are thrilled to launch Adminly in August this year (<em
          >keep reading for a sneak peak at our platform</em
        >)! In 2023 we will offer MetaFriend and begin developing MetaLand.
      </p>
      <h3 id="why-are-we-on-this-mission">Why are we on this mission?</h3>
      <p>
        The global market for well-being services is growing at an accelerating
        rate. Accompanying this growth is an increase in yoga teachers,
        meditation coaches, therapists and providers of other holistic
        approaches.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wellbeing providers often work independently, giving a sense of freedom,
        but also a lack of support with managing the time-consuming
        administrative tasks of running a business. Covid arguably accelerated
        and compounded both this demand for well-being services and transition
        to more independent work.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are here to make a positive difference by building services that
        address these needs in the well-being sector.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em><strong>Adminly aims to help people help more.</strong></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        To ensure Adminly is tailored for the specific needs of well-being
        providers, our <a href="../team">product team</a> has been working
        closely with them throughout the development process. The collective
        diligence of the product team has resulted in considerable progress and
        proven beneficial for our dear providers involved in the testing phase.
      </p>
      <p>
        As promised, here&#39;s a glimpse at the administrative tasks platform
        designed with providers front and center.
      </p>
      <p>

        />
      </p>
      <p>
        A key part of this testing phase involved the in-depth research and
        personalized-support of virtual assistants carefully matched with our
        providers. Here&#39;s what some of our providers have to say about their
        experience with developing Adminly:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <em
            >&quot;Thanks to my VA&#39;s help and support, I feel there is more
            creativity within me. It&#39;s a learning process to be able to tell
            her how she can help me. This is an excellent exercise because it
            makes me reflect on the things that I really need help with or the
            things I need to do and things I would like to do. The experience of
            working with MetaProvide has been great. I appreciate the curiosity
            and interest people have shown in understanding how I
            work.&quot;</em

            having a positive impact on how I conduct my work. Her perspective
            introduced me to things I hadn&#39;t thought of before, contributing
            to reaching my objectives and self development as well as what my
            clients expect of me, what people are looking for. In practical
            terms the relationship pushed me to work on my website and I am now
            considering the idea of starting a podcast. I love the energy of the
            people working for the project. It&#39;s such a diverse group of
            people coming together and sharing the same purpose. This project is
            not only practical or simply a business, but a project driven by a
            process of self discovery and purpose.&quot;</em

        forward (<em>in the right direction</em>)! We&#39;re excited about our

      <h3 id="growing-our-team">Growing our team</h3>
      <p>
        MetaProvide has experienced incredible growth this year. Our HR hero,
        Marcela, has concentrated much of her time on recruitment with five new
        positions identified, approved, and successfully filled. So we are
        currently comprised of sixteen developers, two advisors (Tan Ariyo and
        Martin J) and five people on the board (including our deputees Rolf and
        Anna).
      </p>
      <p><img src="../assets/images/all-team-talk.png" alt="MetaMeeting" /></p>
      <h3 id="strengthening-our-structure">Strengthening our structure</h3>
      <p>
        There has been a heroic volume of fine work executed by Håkan, taking
        care of much of the administrative and financial side of MetaProvide,
        whilst Carlos coordinates the organization&#39;s work and contributes
        with important business perspectives.
      </p>
      <p>
        None of this would be possible without the many talents of Henry,
        Magnus, Igor and Martin, our glorious Tech Team. These titans lavish no
        shortage of care and attention to our fifteen servers, tinkering with
        various platforms, and many other experiments summoned up from dazzling
        code.
      </p>
      <h3 id="investing-in-our-future">Investing in our future</h3>
      <p>
        To date, over 400,000€ has been contributed to MetaProvide in the form
        of membership fees. Last autumn, we also received a membership
        contribution of 5 ETH. An infrastructure has since been created to
        easily and transparently accept cryptocurrencies, both for donations and
        membership contributions.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h2 id="on-our-horizon">On our horizon</h2>
      <p>
        Our team will continue to grow with new virtual assistants to be
        introduced in the coming weeks. We aim to move beyond the eight
        providers we are already supporting to a total of forty providers.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the second year running, the ever-expanding MetaTeam will meet in
        Portugal for five days this July. We’re planning some great activities
        and definitely won’t miss the opportunity to visit MetaLand and
        Sumedharama, a Buddhist Monastery in Ericeira. Be sure to check out our
        next blog for a video of these places.
      </p>
      <p>
        An external expert, Ron Trevor, central for developing the
        Swarm-Nextcloud plugin is also with us several times a week.
        <em>What’s that all about?</em> Ron’s involvement has its origins in a
        simple gift to our main sponsor and benefactor Viktor Trón.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a result of this effort, a tangible WEB3.0 product is on the rise.
        Through solid backend work, we have married Nextcloud with Swarm’s
        decentralized cloud storage. All Nextcloud users will be able to
        interact with Swarm storage, dragging and dropping files without having
        to leave Nextcloud. If you are curious about this development, you can
        follow the work at
        <a href="https://github.com/MetaProvide/nextcloud-swarm-plugin"

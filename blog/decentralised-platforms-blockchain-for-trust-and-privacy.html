        <h3>The Raiding of Centralised Data</h3>
        <p>
            “The intervention is just like that repressive government of Egypt. I didn’t think it could happen in America.” This alarming realisation was shared by Eric Meyer, owner and publisher of the <a href="https://marionrecord.com/direct/updated_illegal_raids_contribute_to_death_of_newspaper_co_owner+5447raid+555044415445443a20496c6c6567616c20726169647320636f6e7472696275746520746f206465617468206f66206e657773706170657220636f2d6f776e6572">Marion County Record</a>, a small family-run newspaper in Kansas raided by police on August 11th. Joan Meyer, a co-owner of the newspaper and Eric’s mother, died the following day after undergoing severe stress from the incident. At 98 years old, Joan described the raids as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/15/joan-meyer-co-owner-kansas-paper-police-raid">“Hitler tactics.”</a> Both her home and the newspaper office were raided during a heat advisory, forcing many staff into the formidable outdoor temperatures to helplessly watch their files, computers, and personal cell phones being carted away.

    If you’re starting to experience flashbacks or hyperventilate with thoughts about a failed project, take a moment and breathe. There is a better way forward with an effective collaboration platform. Perhaps your team is already using collaborative working software, but it’s not doing the trick or has even generated more issues. Or maybe you are currently struggling to weed through and compare the overwhelming range of options for online collaboration tools, whilst also having concerns about the potential risks. Let’s have a look at the good, the bad, and the ugly to help you find the best option for your business and avert any unnecessary drama.

</p>


        <h3>Risks of Using a Collaboration Platform</h3>
<p>
    To streamline communication and foster teamwork, many organisations are relying on collaboration platforms, especially for remote work. These digital solutions support seamless coordination and improve productivity, but are not without risks. Selecting the wrong collaboration platform may not just introduce new problems into your workflow and communications, but it could completely compromise your organisation and clients. Security breaches, data leaks, and the mishandling of sensitive information are just a few potential pitfalls.

</p>
<p>
    Let’s take a closer look at an unfortunate, but sadly not uncommon case. Over 700,000 individuals were exposed when using the Tigo video chat platform. Personal messages, account photos, and email addresses were some of the identifying information stolen in the more than 100 million records leaked. Unfortunately, the company did not protect its clients with proper encryption, nor was it responsive to those raising concerns about possible data breaches.

</p>
<p>
    A more reputable company, T-Mobile, settled for $350 million in a class action lawsuit after 75 million individuals were exposed in a security breach. These incidents cause major harm to both companies and customers, with steep financial costs and long-term reputation damage. According to <a href="https://www.fortinet.com/blog/industry-trends/work-from-anywhere-global-study-2023-highlights">Fortinet’s Global Study</a>, 62% of businesses surveyed experienced a security breach attributable to working remotely. However, only 37% planned a substantial increase in their budgeting towards security concerns. As we have seen, this lack of prioritisation could result in irreparable damage to one’s reputation and finances.

</p>
        <h3>When Collaborative Working Software Actually Works</h3>
<p>
    But don't lose hope just yet. Collaborative working software can be a game-changer when well-vetted and properly implemented. The key is finding the right platform that aligns with your organisation's needs and values. When chosen wisely, these tools can revolutionise the way teams interact, share information, and achieve their goals.

</p>
<p>
    Selecting the right fit for your organisation means consolidating all the vital tools into one easily accessible working space for your team members. Managing different apps and software can be a headache, reducing productivity and collaboration, while increasing security vulnerabilities. According to a <a href ="https://hbr.org/2022/01/research-why-employees-violate-cybersecurity-policies ">Havard Business Review</a> study, 67% of the workers violated security protocols, often trying to increase productivity while under stress. Collaborative working software houses essential tools within one location, so team members are not potentially exposing sensitive data while logging into multiple platforms. At the same time, should any team member become a threat to your organisation, it is easier to remove them from a unified workspace.

</p>
        <h3>Leverage the Best Collaboration Tools
        </h3>

<p>
    So, what makes a collaboration tool the "best"? It's not just about fancy features or a slick user interface. The best collaboration tools are the ones that seamlessly integrate into your organisation's workflow, prioritise security and privacy, and empower your teams to work more efficiently.

</p>
<h3>Finding the Right Collaboration Platform for your Organisation
</h3>

<p>
    When searching for the right collaboration platform for your organisation, there are several factors to consider. Start by assessing your team's specific needs and workflows. What are the pain points in your current collaboration process? What features are essential for your teams to work efficiently?The question of data security is never far away from one’s thinking when considering collaboration and workflows. The answer has always been to show you’re doing your best and trusting that third-party providers will too. With Platformly’s supported self-hosted data and integrated Swarm decentralised data solutions, organisations no longer have to trust others with the keys to their castle. Instead, they can confidentially own it and determine who, when, and where others get to access their information.

</p>

<p>
    Effective team collaboration is the cornerstone of organisational success. Collaboration platforms, when chosen wisely, can enhance communication, streamline workflows, and boost productivity. However, the risks associated with the wrong platform are real. That's why it's crucial to find a solution like Platformly that aligns with your organisation's goals and values. With the right collaboration tool, you can turn communication challenges into opportunities for improved growth and innovation.

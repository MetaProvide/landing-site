        <p>
            Are you prepared for the Great Resignation 2.0? It’s expected to begin in the last quarter of 2023 and could prove particularly devastating for small businesses. This second Great Resignation may be inevitable, but it is possible to keep your team intact and not lose any invaluable employees. Let’s have a look at the unsavoury factors that have created such discontent and disaffection in the workforce, so that your business can survive and even thrive this next wave of upheavals.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates that 20 per cent of UK workers will pursue new employment openings this year. With no end in sight to the cost-of-living increases, <a href="https://employernews.co.uk/news/preparing-for-the-great-resignation-2-0/#:~:text=The%20Great%20Resignation%202.0%20is,is%20challenge%2C%20there%20is%20opportunity.">75 per cent of UK professionals</a> are considering new job opportunities which offer higher pay. As a small business owner, how can you possibly compete with the salaries and benefit packages provided by large well-established companies? The good news and your saving grace: pay is not the sole factor motivating employees to remain in their position or find a new path.
        </p>
        <p>
            The COVID pandemic obviously left huge impressions, not only in our economy, but the way we view life. Many workers are no longer satisfied or willing to waste a significant amount of their precious time in stressful commutes and unfulfilling positions. According to a study by Microsoft, <a href="https://employernews.co.uk/news/preparing-for-the-great-resignation-2-0/#:~:text=The%20Great%20Resignation%202.0%20is,is%20challenge%2C%20there%20is%20opportunity."></a>50 per cent of the UK workforce would consider quitting their jobs if flexible hybrid options were discontinued. At the same time, healthy working relationships with colleagues are often an important factor for retaining employees and are certainly crucial for operating a successful business.
        </p>

        <h3>The Power of Collaboration</h3>
        <p>
            Fostering a collaborative environment is essential for employee satisfaction, innovation, productivity, and business growth. However, creating such a conducive and productive atmosphere can prove quite challenging, especially with fully remote teams.        </p>
        <p>
            According to recent surveys, 33 per cent of employees feel greater loyalty when they sense an ability to collaborate. In turn, 37 per cent remain in their positions because they enjoy working with a great team. However, a staggering 39 per cent of employees believe their organisations don't collaborate enough.
        </p>

        <p>
            These statistics highlight the importance of building a cohesive and collaborative team, regardless of whether your employees work in the same office or remotely. Yes, team-building activities and retreats can bring everyone closer.

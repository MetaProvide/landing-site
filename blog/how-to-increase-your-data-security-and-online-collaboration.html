        <h1>How to Increase Your Data Security and Online Collaboration</h1>
        <p>
            In today's digital age, data security and efficient online collaboration are essential for the success of
            any organisation. However, many large security-conscious organisations without a strong tech background
            struggle to find the right solutions that meet their unique needs. That's where <a ref="../platformly">Platformly</a> comes in.
            Platformly, developed by MetaProvide, is a custom-built collaboration platform designed to address the
            specific requirements of security-conscious organisations, equipped with blockchain-based decentralised data
            storage that ensures unmatched data safety.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
            In 2018, MetaProvide embarked on a mission to support applied practical goodness in the world. Their team of
            programmers, product developers, administrators, and communicators sought to bridge the gap between doing
            good for others and achieving the efficiency and professionalism necessary for growth and success. Today,
            MetaProvide is proud to introduce Platformly, a powerful solution for organisations that value both data
            security and collaboration.
        </p>
        <p>
            Platformly leverages the integration of decentralisation technology, such as Swarm storage, within
            Nextcloud, a highly customisable and mature collaborative platform. Nextcloud caters to all types of
            businesses, organisations, and home users, offering an open-source solution that benefits from community
            contributions. Our Nextcloud Swarm-storage plugin is published and available for download through the
            Nextcloud app store, ensuring easy accessibility and seamless integration.
        </p>
        <p>

            But what sets Platformly apart? With Platformly's Nextcloud-Swarm integration, organisations can consolidate
            multiple external solutions, both open and closed source, into a single software platform. Instead of
            relying on various third-party software and services that lack integration or robust data protection,
            Platformly offers a suite of tools within Nextcloud, including video conferencing and chat, online office,
            file storage, integrated email, calendar, and more. The ability to centralise these tools streamlines
            communication, organisation, and collaboration, enabling teams to work more efficiently.
        </p>
        <p>
            Data security is a top priority for Platformly. Organisations have the option to keep their data on their
            own server or leverage Swarm's encrypted surveillance-free decentralised blockchain-based solution. With
            Platformly, you regain control of your data and eliminate reliance on external services that often come with
            intrusive ads and tracking. Your data remains yours and stays secure, even if your server or backups are
            compromised. By leveraging Swarm's decentralised external storage connected to the blockchain, your files
            are stored securely and encrypted, ensuring unmatched data safety.
        </p>
        <p>
            Platformly offers a range of customisation options to tailor the platform to your organisation's specific
            needs. Whether you require video conferencing and chat capabilities, a Kanban-style project organisation
            tool, a calendar for seamless event management, secure email services, or a file-sharing feature with
            end-to-end encryption, Platformly has you covered. With over 100 additional tools available for
            customisation, you can build a collaboration platform that suits your unique requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
            The future of Platformly holds exciting possibilities. The team is developing a Wallet-login feature called
            "NextWallet," which will bridge Web2 to Web3 through MetaMask integration. Additionally, they are exploring
            the use and exchange of BZZ, Swarm's native token, within the platform. With an expanding user base of over
            400,000 existing Nextcloud servers and 200,000 Owncloud servers, the potential for Swarm integration in
            Nextcloud is vast. This includes increased decentralized data storage usage, blockchain interaction,
            bee-node hosting, and more. The team at MetaProvide is committed to making Swarm Integration in Nextcloud
            even more convenient and user-friendly.

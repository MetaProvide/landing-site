      <h2>The Service for Well-Being Explorers</h2>
      <p>
        Many of us are exploring how we can grow as people, and sometimes we
        also need some guidance on how best to navigate life.
      </p>
      <p>
        With Adminly we support well-being providers, enabling them to
        successfully help individuals through their area of expertise. With
        Insidely we want to offer a free-of-charge platform where you and
        others can explore vetted providers, finding trusted services that will
        help you grow as a person and support you in the needs that you have.
      </p>
      <p>
        Insidely will also enable you to make an appointment with an
        assistant, who can help you navigate and clarify what might be best for
        you in your situation. Their advice will never be driven by financial
        motives; they are simply there to help explore which
        providers and services genuinely might be best for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        The development of the Insidely platform will follow the launch of our
        Adminly services in 2022. We look forward to supporting you, in your
        journey of growth.

      <h2>Our Land of Retreat</h2>
      <p>
        We are in an age where the climate and our natural environment is at the
        forefront of public debate. We are also at a time where a sense of
        meaning in life has eroded for many people. There are many opinions, and
        it’s hard to find non-biased open initiatives exploring how we best can
        live in a sustainable and personally meaningful way.
      </p>
      <p>
        We at MetaProvide may not have solutions to solve the many complex
        problems that we face. However, what we do have is beautiful natural
        land in the Portuguese countryside. Through our MetaLand Association we
        want to explore multi-disciplinary approaches to address the human
        condition, whilst building a community together (in collaboration with
        other organisations).
      </p>
      <p>
        Permaculture, tech-labs, and meditation huts are intended to be part of
        the land, where we will allow the natural ecosystem to flourish,
        enjoying both solitude and time together.
      </p>
      <p>
        Is this your passion? Do you feel inspired to develop this land and
        vision with us? <a href="contact">Get in touch</a> and share how
        you might be able to help and be involved with MetaLand. We’d be happy
        to hear from you and learn about how you could contribute towards its
        success.

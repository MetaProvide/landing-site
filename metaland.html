      <p>
        We are in an age where the climate and our natural environment is at the
        forefront of public debate. We are also at a time where a sense of
        meaning in life has eroded for many people. There are many opinions, and
        it’s hard to find non-biased open initiatives exploring how we best can
        live in a sustainable and personally meaningful way.
      </p>
      <p>
        We at MetaProvide may not have solutions to solve the many complex
        problems that we face. However, what we do have is beautiful natural
        land in the Portuguese countryside. Through our MetaLand Association we
        want to explore multi-disciplinary approaches to address the human
        condition, whilst building a community together (in collaboration with
        other organisations).
      </p>
      <p>
        Permaculture, tech-labs and meditation huts are intended to be part of
        the land, where we will allow the natural ecosystem to flourish,
        enjoying both solitude and time together.
      </p>
      <p>
        Is this your passion, do you feel inspired to develop this land and
        vision with us? <a href="contact.html">Get in touch</a> and share how
        you might be able to help and be involved with MetaLand. We’d be happy
        to hear from you, and learn about how you could contribute towards its
        success.

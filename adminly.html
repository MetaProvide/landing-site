      <h1>The Service for Wellbeing Providers</h1>
      <p>
        Adminly is our area of focus for providers of wellbeing services, such
        as meditation and yoga teachers, coaches, therapists and providers of
        other holistic approaches.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wellbeing providers often work independently and may not have the
        resources to manage everything by themselves. If you are a provider,
        Adminly is developing services to help you free up your time connected
        to administration, marketing and other business related tasks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Partly the focus is on the development of tools that aid you in
        providing your services, but also automated or streamlined solutions for
        managing administrative tasks. However, apart from tech driven
        solutions, the human touch will also be there. The latter will be in the
        form of Online Assistants, that will help you manage tasks and grow your
        business.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our motto is <i>"to help others help more"</i>. We are currently
        developing our services with privacy at the core, launching in the
        second half of 2022. If you are a wellbeing provider, and this resonates
        with you, get in touch! We will need providers to trial our services,
        and/or offer feedback on areas where help is needed, so
        <a href="contact.html">weâ€™d love to hear from you</a>.

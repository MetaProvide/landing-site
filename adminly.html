            <p>Adminly Wellness is our platform and service for providers of well-being services, such as meditation and
                yoga teachers, coaches, therapists, and providers of other holistic approaches. Learn more on our
                service homepage: <a href="https://adminly.org">https://www.adminly.org/</a></p>

            <p>Well-being providers often work independently and often do not have the resources to manage everything by
                themselves. If you are a provider, Adminly is developing services to help you free up your time
                connected to administration, marketing, and other business related tasks.</p>

            <p>Partly our focus is on the development of tools that aid you in providing your services, but also
                automated or streamlined solutions for managing administrative tasks. In addition to tech driven
                solutions, the human touch will also be there. The latter will be in the form of Online Assistants, that
                will help you manage tasks and grow your business.</p>

            <p>Our motto is "to help others help more". We have developed our services with privacy at the core. If you
                are a well-being provider, and this resonates with you, get in touch! We need providers to refine our
                services, and/or offer feedback on areas where help is needed, so weâ€™d love to hear from you. </p>

            <h4>The Service for Well-Being Explorers</h4>

            <p>Many of us are exploring how we can grow as people, and sometimes we also need some guidance on how best
                to navigate life.</p>
            <p>With Insidely we want to offer a free-of-charge platform where you and others can explore vetted
                providers, finding trusted services that will help you grow as a person and support you in the needs
                that you have. For this project a Swedish zero-profit organisation is created.</p>
            <p>Insidely will also enable you to make an appointment with an assistant, who can help you navigate and
                clarify what might be best for you in your situation. Their advice will never be biased; they are simply
                there to help explore which providers and services genuinely might be best for you.</p>
            <p>The development of the Insidely platform will be dependent on the level of completeness of Adminly. We
                look forward to supporting you, in your journey of growth.</p>

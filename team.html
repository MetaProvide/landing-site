      <p>
        In 2018 a Buddhist monk finds himself in a Swedish university library,
        when approached by a student asking who he is and why he is there. Their
        ensuing conversation created the initial spark for the vision, that
        would gradually evolve into MetaProvide.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are now an international team of programmers, product developers,
        administrators, communicators, and that (now former) monk and IT student
        that started it all. We’re excited to make a difference through the
        services that we’re building. So, please allow us to introduce ourselves.

      <h1>The Service for Wellbeing Explorers</h1>
      <p>
        Many of us are exploring how we can grow as people, and sometimes we
        also need some guidance on how best to navigate life.
      </p>
      <p>
        With Adminly we support wellbeing providers, enabling them to
        successfully help individuals through their area of expertise. With
        MetaFriend we want to offer a free-of-charge platform where you and
        others can explore vetted providers, finding trusted services that will
        help you grow as a person and support you in the needs that you have.
      </p>
      <p>
        MetaFriend will also enable you to make an appointment with an
        assistant, who can help you navigate and clarify what might be best for
        you in your circumstance. Their advice will never be driven by financial
        motives; they are simply there to help explore in dialogue what
        providers and servces genuinely might be best for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        The development of the MetaFriend platform will follow the launch of our
        Adminly services in 2022. We look forward to supporting you, in your
        journey of growth.
